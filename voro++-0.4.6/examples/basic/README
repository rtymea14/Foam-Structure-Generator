Voro++ basic example codes
==========================
These programs demonstrate some basic usage of the Voro++ library.

1. import.cc demonstrates the ability of the code to import a list of particles
from a text file. The code imports a text file called 'pack_ten_cube' which
contains a thousand particles in a cube of side length 10. Each line of this
file has the form:

<Numerical ID> <x coordinate> <y coordinate> <z coordinate>

The code imports the particles into the container, and then saves the particles
and Voronoi cells in gnuplot and POV-Ray formats. To visualize the particles in
gnuplot, use the command:

splot 'pack_ten_cube' u 2:3:4 with points, 'pack_ten_cube.gnu' with lines

To create a POV-Ray rendering of the particles, the scene header file
import.pov must be used, which includes the output from the program. To render
an 800x600 image with antialiasing, use the command:

povray +W800 +H600 +A0.01 +Oimport.png import.pov
